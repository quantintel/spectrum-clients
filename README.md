spectrum-clients
================

This project hosts the utility to generate client stubs in a variety of languages which
enable access via service invocations to a spectrum-service instance.

The spectrum-clients utility uses swagger-codegen and therefore has the ability
to generate client stubs in the following languages:

Scala
C-Sharp
Android-java
Objective-C

swagger-codegen supports additional languages which may be included at a later point in time.
